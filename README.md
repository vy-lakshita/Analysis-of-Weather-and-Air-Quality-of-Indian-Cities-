# This File explores how different pollutants and geographical conditions affect the air in different cities of India.
It makes use of different multivariate techniques and R packages to explore the data set.Link to [website](https://vy-lakshita.github.io/Analysis-of-Weather-and-Air-Quality-of-Indian-Cities-/) .

## Key Insights
* The cities in the north like Noida, Delhi , Kanpur , Lucknow, Patna, Agra , Karnal lie in north of India. Pollution in these areas could be due to **stubble burning** and bad weather conditions like **low wind speed and high temperature**.

* The cities like Ahmedabad, Vadodra , Vapi , Mumbai, Chennai seem to have low pollution due to good geographical condition - **proximity costal area or water body.** 

* The cities like Dehradun, Shimla, Sangli , Udaipur , Bikaner do not have major industries that contribute to bad air quality. They are mostly **destinations for vacations.**

* Other cities  like Ambala, Thanesar, Karnal, Agra are **major manufacturing hub**s. In Agra the pollution can also be linked to** tourism** that leads to  rise in levels of co and no.

* We can easily observe that the most polluted cities Faridabad , Noida , New Delhi , Agra etc are in **north of India**. Irregular farming practices like **stubble burning, livestock farming and excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides** is responsible for pollution . In addition to that **vehicular emission, improper waste disposal and manufacturing company's non- compliance to regulations** lead to rise in pollutants.
## Actions

* Adoption of **Sustainable Agricultural Practices** (PUSA Bio decomposer) and raising their awareness. This process leads to long term benefits to **soil health , economic and environmental benefit**.  

* Implementing stringent rules and penalties on manufacturing organisation that do not treat gases before its emission in enviornment.

* Simple solutions like **car pooling , household waste management , implementation and usage of public transportation** is the key  to reduce pollutants. 

* **Incentivizing diversification of crops** and providing financial assistance and to farmers for it.

* **Specific policies can be developed for all high polluted clustered cities** with similar geographical and weather condition.
